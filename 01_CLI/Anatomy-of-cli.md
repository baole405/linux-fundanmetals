# Anatomy of a CLI Command
- REPL = Read Evaluate Print Loop; run one command at a time, see output, repeat.
- Shell (bash by default) interprets your line; emulator is the window (Terminal, Windows Terminal, etc).
- Use commands to navigate, read/write files, network, etc; same power as GUI.
- Most programs accept `--help` for quick usage (e.g. `pwd --help`).
- Run commands individually; simple loops/pipes chain commands to do more.
