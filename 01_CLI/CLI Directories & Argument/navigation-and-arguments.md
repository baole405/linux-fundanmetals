# Navigation & Arguments
- `pwd` prints present working directory; shows absolute path like `/home/ubuntu`.
- Paths use `/outer/inner`; `/` is root. `~` means your home.
- `ls` lists contents; `ls ..` shows parent; `ls /home` uses absolute path.
- `cd ..` go up; `cd .` stay; `cd /home/ubuntu` jump to absolute; `cd ~/snap` uses home shortcut.
- Relative (`.` `..`) vs absolute (`/home/ubuntu`) paths: local directions vs full address.
- Arguments = extra info after program name (`cd ..`, `ls /home`, `echo hi`, `which ls`); some required, some optional.
