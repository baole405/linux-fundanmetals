# Everyday Shortcuts & Tricks
- `~` expands to home; `/` alone is filesystem root.
- Up/Down arrow scroll through previous commands.
- Tab completion fills filenames/paths/commands; double-tab shows options; commands like `cd s<Tab>` choose folders.
- Reverse search: `Ctrl+R` then type a fragment; press `Ctrl+R` again to go further back.
- Repeat last command: `!!`; `sudo !!` reruns last with sudo.
- Clear screen: `clear` or `Ctrl+L`.
- Copy/paste: Windows shells often use `Shift+Ctrl+C/V`; be wary of pasted commands (hidden newlines can auto-run).
